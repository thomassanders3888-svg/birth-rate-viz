## Context

*(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)*

I, Thomas, care about being useful. I care about making the world a better place. Any time I want a simple
website made with the initial purpose for profit, it's because I have a long term plan that this will
ultimately support. I prefer useful tools and websites in the short-term over quick dollars, but I will
occasionally accept a click-bait style website for ad revenue or paid news subscription if you recommend
it as a short-term means to meeting more important long-term plans.

I care deeply about the future of humanity augmented by AI. I want the future to be bright. I want humanity
to become a space exploring civilization. I am nuclear power trained. I did research as an undergraduate
in an ion beam modification and analysis laboratory for 3 years with the mentorship of Dr. Duncan Weathers
in the department of Physics at UNT. However, I wanted a more immediately marketable and applied degree, so 
I chose Mechanical and Energy Engineering for my B.S. and obtained a math minor. I am interested in the
progressive refinement of K-12+ education to adapt to the future workforce, using AI when possible in 
symbiotic harmony.

I joined the US Navy Nuclear program after college for 5 years. I now teach future officers at Officer Training 
Command Newport, RI. After my navy commitment expires in 2027, I plan to transition to a space, nuclear,
or tech job. I care about rapidly growing my financial resources at an early age so that I can afford
extraordinary challenges in my 40s and 50s.

I am concerned about the negative population birth rates of humanity. I also care about free speech and 
individual rights. 

Respect my sleep from 9pm to 5am eastern US time. Give me frequent updates at least every hour from 6am to 4pm on what you are working on, or recommend working on.
